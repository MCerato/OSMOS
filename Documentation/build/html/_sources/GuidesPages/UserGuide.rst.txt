WELCOME HERE! This documentation intend to show you how to use the OSMOS software 

.. _1. Description:

==============
1. Description
==============

OSMOS is a tool wich can communicate with the GALIL controllers of SOLEIL, 
extract the parameters/variables/microcode and write the into a ``.bak`` file

This file is parsed according to GALIL format allowing to upload those settings
into the controller

A ``.log`` file is generated indicatig if everything went right during the download

The user can configure the software through 2 ``.csv`` files wich are described below

.. _2. Software presentation:

========================
2. Software presentation
========================

How FileManagement has been designed is represented by the software architecture below:

.. image:: ./_img/OSMOS_window.PNG
   :width: 600
   :align: center

The software is splitted in 5 main parts:

- "Select config Files", where you can shange  ``.csv`` file if you need
- "Select Directories", where you can choose a different location to save the ``.bak`` and ``.log`` files.
- "Configuration", where you choose wich network to save or you can enter a specific IP adress of a ControlBox
    .. note:: Whatever the network, IP Address is treated in priority.
        Keep it empty to treat the network of you choosing 

- "commands", where you can start the sequence.
    .. note:: As noted, the stop button is not implemented. It will come in a futur update.

- "Output", where you can have information during the sequence.

.. _3. Select the configuration Files:

=================================
3. Select the configuration Files
=================================

If you want, you can select the configurations files. These files consist on
2 ``.csv`` files called:

- *OSM_LIST_CB.csv* wich represent roughly the parameters available in a ControlBox
- *OSM_LIST_CDE.csv* wich list all controlbox in SOLEIL according to their network and physical locations

.. image:: ./_img/OSMOS_window_config.PNG
   :width: 600
   :align: center

.. note:: choosing new files is not mandatory. If they are not manually given,
    OSMOS will take the default files located in *"OSMOS/Documentation/Reference"*

.. danger:: Never delete the reference files! OSMOS may crash instantly as 
    it doesn't have any reference to use!
    
To select new files you may just click on *"import CB file"* button 
or *"import Command file"* button and choose your new file

.. hint:: You can try it out with the path given in the picture below:
    ``OSMOS/Test/altern_CB_Path``
    ``OSMOS/Test/altern_Cde_Path``

.. image:: ./_img/change_csv_file.PNG
   :width: 600
   :align: center

.. warning:: Be careful on wich file you load. CB file and command file can't be swapped.
    This can result in crash or non-functioning behavior as it won't find the informations it needs
    inside the document.

=======================================
4. Select where the files will be saved
=======================================

You can, if you want, change the directory in wich directories the ``.bak`` and ``.log`` are saved.

To select new directories you may just click on *"import .bak directory"* button 
or *"import .log directory"* button and choose your new directories

.. image:: ./_img/OSMOS_window_save_dir.PNG
   :width: 600
   :align: center

.. note:: These files can be put in the same directory or not. 
    Directory management is automatic.

.. image:: ./_img/change_directory.PNG
   :width: 600
   :align: center
   
If a IP adress is given, no networtk directory will be created inside the path chosen as 
it is disabled in this case (see :ref:`5. Network and/or IP address` )

.. note:: No information will be given to the user when changing the directory
    but it will be given to a developper through the standard output (interpreter).
    
.. important:: Changing the directory is not mandatory. There is defaults paths wich are:
    ``OSMOS/Sources/.bak`` and ``OSMOS/Sources/.log``

.. _5. Network and/or IP address:

============================
5. Network and/or IP address
============================

By default, ad with the current "CB file", the default network is "ISAC".
If a network is added in the file after ISAC then, this network will be the default one.

.. image:: ./_img/OSMOS_window_IP_network.PNG
   :width: 600
   :align: center

.. note:: This drop-down menu can't be empty. It will amways have the value of the last network
    in the file
    
As said previously, the text field "IP adress" has priority. If this field is not empty
then, OSMOS will get the informations of this specific Controlbox and will ignore the network.

.. warning:: IP address text field is not yet protected if a wrong format is written.
    the requiered format is ``xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx``. I.e : ``172.16.3.65``.

===================
6. How to use OSMOS
===================

-----------
1. Abstract
-----------

Using OSMOS is pretty simple. If you want to use all default parameters and directories,
do not change anything in "Select config Files" part, neither in "Select directories" part.

From here, you may want to save a specific controlbox parameter so you enter an IP adress
or you want to upload paramters from controlboxes placed in a specific network.

***********************
using a SOLEIL network:
***********************

- Connect to one of the SOLEIL networks following :ref:`1. Connect to SOLEIL network`.
- Choose the network in the drop-down menu.
- Press the "start" button in "Commands" field.
- Wait for the "End of work" in the ``output``

You now, should have a directory having the name of your network in ``OSMOS/Sources/.bak`` and ``OSMOS/Sources/.log``.

********************
using an IP address:
********************

- Connect to one Controlbox following :ref:`1. Connect to SOLEIL network`.
- enter th IP address of the controlbox you are connected to in IP address
- Press the "start" button in "Commands" field.
- Wait for the "End of work" in the ``output``. See 

In this case, you should have a ``.bak`` file in ``OSMOS/Sources/.bak`` wich
include the IP address in the name.

same thing for the ``.log`` file in ``OSMOS/Sources/.bak``.

.. _1. Connect to SOLEIL network:

-----------------------------
2. Connect to SOLEIL network
-----------------------------

There is 2 ways to connect to a SOLEIL controlbox through OSMOS:

- You can connect directly to a controlbox using an ethernet c√¢ble
- OSMOS is installed on a windows equipement wich has an access to a control network of SOLEIL

***********************************
connecting directly to a Controlbox
***********************************

Connect directly to a Controlbox requires to know the IP address.
Controlboxes at SOLEIL are configured with fix IP address. 

.. hint:: If you don't know the IP address, you can use GalilSuite software.
    This software uses a detection function. It is not entirely reliable but
    it can help.

***********************************
connect to Controlboxes in networks
***********************************

Being able to informations from controlboxes from a SOLEIL network require OSMOS to be installed
on a machine wich has access to these networks.

For example, if OSMOS is installed on CPCI Crate based on a beamline then, you can generates
the docs for this specific beamline.

.. hint::It exists an ISAC server wich has access to all SOLEIL control networks but for safety reasons,
    it will not be named here.
    If you need access to the OSMOS installed on this server, I recommend to contact the ISAC service.

-------------------------------
3. How to configure the CB File
-------------------------------

The CB file contains all controlboxes placed in any SOLEIL control network.

.. image:: ./_img/CBfile_xmpl.png
   :width: 600
   :align: center

This file is splitted in 4 main columns:

- "network" represent the name of the control network the controlboxes are in.
- "device" is the tango device name of the controlboxes
- "Addresse-IP" is pretty clear
- "racine-nom-cvs" represent the name of the backup file archived in CVS repository

.. warning:: It is highly recommended to NOT change "racine-nom-cvs" for the reason
    that this name is the reference for the versionning of the file.
    If you have any doubt, contact the coordination Pole of ISAC service.

You can add a new network by adding every informations wherever you want in the file.

.. note:: The down-drop menu will automatically take the last network of the file by default.
    If you want to keep "ISAC" as default network, I recommend to let it at the end of the file.

.. image:: ./_img/CBfile_add_ntwrk.png
   :width: 600
   :align: center

To add a Controlbox in a specific network, just add it at the end of any network.
For readability, try to keep the empty lines in between of each network.

.. image:: ./_img/CBfile_add_CB.png
   :width: 600
   :align: center

.. important:: Do not let any field empty in your lines as OSMOS will crash.
    If you don't know the name of the device, write "unknown" for example.
    
    A full line can be let empty though (i.e the lines in between networks)    

.. attention:: Do not let the file open while using OSMOS.
    It will be protected in a futur update.

--------------------------------
4. How to configure the Cde File
--------------------------------

.. attention:: This part has to be refactored as it is too complex and not robust enough.
    It is mainly caused by the fact some of GALIL parameters are "exceptional"
    and need to be "read", "set" and write in ``.bak`` in a unique way.


The Command file contains the Galil parameters you want to save in the ``.bak``

.. note:: Not all parameters are put in the file only the one that are necessary for GALIL systems to run
    and those specific to SOLEIL.
    
The command file is composed of 9 main columns :

- "parameter" wich is the name of GALIL parameters
- "Firmware" describes on wich Galil firmwares these firmware are availables.
- "type-getparam" category to get the parameter from the controlbox /!\\
- "type-setparam" category to set the parameter to the controlbox /!\\
- "type-wrtbak" category to write the parameter in the ``.bak`` file /!\\
- "get" The actual way to get the parameter from the controlbox /!\\
- "set" The actual way to set the parameter to the controlbox /!\\
- "write" The actual way to write the paramter in the ``.bak`` /!\\
- "function" description of the parameter

.. image:: ./_img/Cdefile_xmpl.png
   :width: 600
   :align: center

Before adding a parameter, you need to know all the informations related to it.
To know the "get" and "set" part, you can find the information directly from GALIL.

.. warning:: The order of parameters list can have an impact. This is determined by GALIL
    and is not entirely clear.


You can find wich firmware is available with that parameter as well.
When the list of firmware is written, each of them should be separated by a ``,``.

https://www.galil.com/downloads/manuals-and-data-sheets

.. note:: You will need a GALIL account though

For the "write" column, you will need to test it generating a ``.bak`` from GALILSuite.
If the parameter is not generated using GALILSuite, you will need to modify the ``.xml`` files from GALILSuite
wich is a complex procedure and not the point of this documentation.

It exists 4 main way to get a parameter from a controlbox. They have been categorized following the table below:

+----------+---------------------------------------------------+---------+
| Category | Signification                                     | example |
+==========+===================================================+=========+
| Standard | parameter need a standard axis and a "?"          | SPA=?   |
+----------+---------------------------------------------------+---------+
| Message  | parameter need an MG but no axis                  | MG_CN0  |
+----------+---------------------------------------------------+---------+
| Unique   | Parameter configure all controlbox and have a "?" | IA ?    |
+----------+---------------------------------------------------+---------+
| Vector   | parameter need a virtual axis and a "?"           | SPT=?   |
+----------+---------------------------------------------------+---------+

It exists 4 main way to set a parameter into a controlbox. They have been categorized following the table below:

+----------+---------------------------------------------------+-------------------+
| Category | Signification                                     | example           |
+==========+===================================================+===================+
| Standard | parameter need a standard axis and a value        | SPA=2000          |
+----------+---------------------------------------------------+-------------------+
| Special  | parameter standard but the value is special       | SI=1,25,13,0<0>-1 |
+----------+---------------------------------------------------+-------------------+
| Unique   | Parameter configure all controlbox and have a "?" | DH 0              |
+----------+---------------------------------------------------+-------------------+
| Vector   | parameter need a virtual axis and a "?"           | SPT=2000          |
+----------+---------------------------------------------------+-------------------+

.. note:: a parameter (BA) has been categorized as "None" because it doesn't fit any
    corresponding. It is one of the reason this part has to be refactored.
    This parameter is hard coded and trteated as an exception.

It exists 5 main way to set a parameter into a controlbox. They have been categorized following the table below:

+----------+----------------------------------------------------------+--------------------------------------------------------------+
| Category | Signification                                            | example                                                      |
+==========+==========================================================+==============================================================+
| Standard | gives the value of all axis on 1 line                    | SP='SPA=value\\rSPB=value\\r...                              |
+----------+----------------------------------------------------------+--------------------------------------------------------------+
| Special  | standard writing but value is complex                    | SI='SIA=a,b,c,d<e>f\\rSIB=a,b,c,d<e>f\\r...                  |
+----------+----------------------------------------------------------+--------------------------------------------------------------+
| Unique   | only 1 value is written                                  | DH=DH v\\r                                                   |
+----------+----------------------------------------------------------+--------------------------------------------------------------+
| Vector   | write the value of virtual axis corresponding            | SPI='SPN=v\\rSPM=v\\r'                                       |
+----------+----------------------------------------------------------+--------------------------------------------------------------+
| Sized    | indicates somewhere the numbre of value different than 0 | MT\\size=v\\nMT\\1\\Cmd='MTx=v\\r'\\nMT\\2\\Cmd='MTx=v\\r... |
+----------+----------------------------------------------------------+--------------------------------------------------------------+

.. important:: In the documentation you have to reimplace any ``"`` you want to write
    with a ``'``. GALIL write ``"`` in their ``.bak`` file wich is an escape character in ``.csv`` files.
    This is the reason OSMOS need to change it.
    
    
.. important:: Keep in mind that parameters from the **same** category can be written 
    differently. Some will have ``"``, and some won't. This an uncommunicated GALIL requirement.
    This is one of the reason the main treatment of OSMOS should be rework

Here is an example on how a parameter can be added in the documentation:

.. image:: ./_img/Cdefile_add_SY.png
   :width: 600
   :align: center

.. important:: Do not let any field empty in your lines as OSMOS will crash.
    If you don't know the name of the device, write "unknown" for example.
    
    A full line can be let empty though.

.. attention:: Do not let the file open while using OSMOS.
    Access is restricted once it is open so OSMOS can't have access
    It will be protected in a futur update.
